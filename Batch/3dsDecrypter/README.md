# 3DS Decrypter

## How to use

1. Add the binaries in the **bin** folder to your PATH
2. Add the **3dsDecrypter.bat** file to the directory with the encrypted .CIA or .3DS file
3. Then open the directory of the batch file either in CMD or PowerShell and run it.

**Please Note -** If for some reason it does not decrypt, decompress the *decrypt_v2.zip* file in the **compressed** directory and add the **seeddb.bin** file to the same directory as the batch file. Then try running the batch file again.
